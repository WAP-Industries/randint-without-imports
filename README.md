using first principles ğŸ¤“, implement a function which outputs a random number given a range (start, stop) ğŸ’€. remember, you cannot import anyÂ modulesÂ ğŸ¤“ğŸ¤“

*** Implementation
- Create a `randint.py` that has a function that reads a file containing a number, and performs transformations to get a random number within a given range
- Every frame...
  - Generate a random floating point number in VBScript (no imports required)
  - Write the number to `number.txt`
