using first principles ğŸ¤“, implement a function which outputs a random number given a range (start, stop) ğŸ’€. remember, you cannot import anyÂ modulesÂ ğŸ¤“ğŸ¤“
  
### Implementation
1. Create a `randint.py` that has a function that reads a file containing a number, and performs transformations to get a random number within a given range
2. Start infinite loop that...
   - Generates a random floating point number in VBScript (no imports required)
   - Writes the number to `number.txt` in the root directory
